#IronNation API

##Why

- Why not!? Gotta have someplace to store that data.  

##What For?

- Easy, gathering data to plan for the IronNationâ„¢ hackathon.

##When is that again?

- January 6-8, 2017

##What's in this?

- At the moment, just 2 tables.  A user and a team.  Both hit simple api endpoints.  Much work still needs to happen, but this will do the jorb for now.
